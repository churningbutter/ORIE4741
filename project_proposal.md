Memo to Svante Myrick the Mayor of Ithaca

It should identify a question, and a data set that you'll use to answer the question.

Question: Where are the "food deserts" in Ithaca? A food desert as defined by Data sets:

Tompkins County census data and cartographic boundary files from https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/#NAV_2122698_4
(Scraping some of the data from the Google API with the use of http://py-googlemaps.sourceforge.net/ to find grocery stores)
(Scraping some of the data from the TCATbus.com website for a list of bus stops use Chrome Developer tools)
The data we need is who lives in the different regions of Ithaca, what their financial status is (e.g. household income, dependents at home, car owner), if they have access to public transportation, where stores that hold fresh groceries are located, and what the prices of products in those stores are.

Justify why the problem is important, and why you think the data set will allow you to (begin to) answer the question.

Food deserts make certain foods (in particular, healthy and fresh foods) hard to access for the average citizen living in that area. Giving people access to healthier foods is important for the overall public health.

Justify why it's worthwhile to this enterprise for you to work on the project for a few months, and why you think you're likely to succeed.

Locating the food deserts will show where it would be most beneficial to build things like supermarkets and grocery stores, and thus show where a new store of this type would likely generate the most traffic and profit.
